# PDFs folder

Place any PDF files you want publicly available on the website in this folder.

Example:
- `resume.pdf` → accessible at `static/assets/pdfs/resume.pdf`

Notes:
- After you add a PDF, push to GitHub and the file will be served by GitHub Pages.
- Use the path `static/assets/pdfs/<yourfile>.pdf` when linking or embedding in your markdown.
- Filenames are case-sensitive on the server.

Security:
- Only place files you are happy to share publicly.
